# IoMeter
> *Arduino-based Smart Energy Meter (Electronics)*

### Key Idea
The objective of this project is to create an Arduino and IoT-based solution that monitors the electricity/energy consumption rates of households and buildings. The system will send this data to a server for monitoring purposes and also provide users with alerts if their energy consumption exceeds a certain threshold range. This will help users become more aware of their electricity usage, enabling them to make informed decisions to reduce their usage after receiving the alert.
